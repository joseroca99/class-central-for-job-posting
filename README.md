# class-central-for-job-posting
Let me tell you the story of this project. As part of a job selection process. I was asked to copy www.classcentral.com and translate it to hindi. By the time I write this, the page is in http://joseroca99.pythonanywhere.com but I feel dirty clonning website so eventually it will be down.

# Key files on this repo:
url_lists.py retreives the index.html, extracts all the links and retreives all the level one webpages.
insert_tags.py insert django template tags in the index to connect it to the other pages using django.
hindiConv.py translates all the pages from english to hindi, the languages can be changed.

# Make sure to read the comments on the python files to know how to use the codes
